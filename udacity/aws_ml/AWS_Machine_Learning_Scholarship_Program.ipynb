    "## Lesson 2: Software Engineering Practices Part I\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll learn about the following practices of software engineering and how they apply in data science.\n",
    "- Writing clean and modular code\n",
    "- Writing efficient code\n",
    "- Code refactoring\n",
    "- Adding meaningful documentation\n",
    "- Using version control\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lesson following this one (Part II) you'll also learn these software engineering practices:\n",
    "- Testing\n",
    "- Logging\n",
    "- Code reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Clean and Modular Code\n",
    "\n",
    "- __PRODUCTION CODE__: software running on production servers to handle live users and data of the intended audience. Note this is different from production quality code, which describes code that meets expectations in reliability, efficiency, etc., for production. Ideally, all code in production meets these expectations, but this is not always the case.\n",
    "- __CLEAN__: <font color=blue>readable, simple, and concise</font>. A characteristic of production quality code that is crucial for collaboration and maintainability in software development.\n",
    "- __MODULAR__: logically broken up into functions and modules. Also an important characteristic of production quality code that makes your code more organized, efficient, and reusable.\n",
    "- __MODULE__: a file. Modules allow code to be reused by encapsulating them into files that can be imported into other files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following describes code that is CLEAN?\n",
    "- Simple\n",
    "- Readable\n",
    "- Concise\n",
    "\n",
    "Making your code MODULAR makes it easier to\n",
    "- Reuse your code\n",
    "- Write less code\n",
    "- Read your code\n",
    "- Collaborate on code\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Refactoring Code\n",
    "\n",
    "- __REFACTORING__: restructuring your code to improve its internal structure, without changing its external functionality. This gives you a chance to clean and modularize your program after you've got it working.\n",
    "- Since it isn't easy to write your best code while you're still trying to just get it working, allocating time to do this is essential to producing high quality code. Despite the initial time and effort required, this really pays off by speeding up your development time in the long run.\n",
    "- You become a much stronger programmer when you're constantly looking to improve your code. The more you refactor, the easier it will be to structure and write good code the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Refactor?\n",
    "- Reduce workload in long run \n",
    "- Easier to maintain code \n",
    "- Reuse more of your code\n",
    "- Become a better developer\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Writing Clean Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing Clean Code: Meaningful Names\n",
    ">Tip: Use meaningful names\n",
    "- __Be descriptive and imply type__ - E.g. for booleans, you can prefix with `is_` or `has_` to make it clear it is a condition. You can also use part of speech to imply types, like verbs for functions and nouns for variables.\n",
    "- __Be consistent but clearly differentiate__ - E.g. `age_list` and `age` is easier to differentiate than `ages` and `age`.\n",
    "- __Avoid abbreviations and especially single letters__ - (Exception: counters and common math variables) Choosing when these exceptions can be made can be determined based on the audience for your code. If you work with other data scientists, certain variables may be common knowledge. While if you work with full stack engineers, it might be necessary to provide more descriptive names in these cases as well.\n",
    "- __Long names != descriptive names__ - You should be descriptive, but only with relevant information. E.g. good functions names describe what they do well without including details about implementation or highly specific uses.\n",
    "Try testing how effective your names are by asking a fellow programmer to guess the purpose of a function or variable based on its name, without looking at your code. Coming up with meaningful names often requires effort to get right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing Clean Code: Nice Whitespace\n",
    ">Tip: Use whitespace properly\n",
    "- Organize your code with consistent indentation - the standard is to use 4 spaces for each indent. You can make this a default in your text editor.\n",
    "- Separate sections with blank lines to keep your code well organized and readable.\n",
    "- Try to limit your lines to around 79 characters, which is the guideline given in the PEP 8 style guide. In many good text editors, there is a setting to display a subtle line that indicates where the 79 character limit is.\n",
    "For more guidelines, check out the code layout section of PEP 8 in the notes below.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 6. Writing Modular Code\n",
    "\n",
    ">Tip: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)\n",
    "- Don't repeat yourself! Modularization allows you to reuse parts of your code. Generalize and consolidate repeated code in functions or loops.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Tip: Abstract out logic to improve readability\n",
    "- Abstracting out code into a function not only makes it less repetitive, but also improves readability with descriptive function names. Although your code can become more readable when you abstract out logic into functions, it is possible to over-engineer this and have way too many modules, so use your judgement.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Tip: Minimize the number of entities (functions, classes, modules, etc.)\n",
    "- There are tradeoffs to having function calls instead of inline logic. If you have broken up your code into an unnecessary amount of functions and modules, you'll have to jump around everywhere if you want to view the implementation details for something that may be too small to be worth it. Creating more modules doesn't necessarily result in effective modularization.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Tip: Functions should do one thing\n",
    "- Each function you write should be focused on doing one thing. If a function is doing multiple things, it becomes more difficult to generalize and reuse. Generally, if there's an \"and\" in your function name, consider refactoring.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Tip: Arbitrary variable names can be more effective in certain functions\n",
    "- Arbitrary variable names in general functions can actually make the code more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Tip: Try to use fewer than three arguments per function\n",
    "- Try to use no more than three arguments when possible. This is not a hard rule and there are times it is more appropriate to use many parameters. But in many cases, it's more effective to use fewer arguments. Remember we are modularizing to simplify our code and make it more efficient to work with. If your function has a lot of parameters, you may want to rethink how you are splitting this up.\n",

    "- In-line comments are text following hash symbols throughout your code. They are used to explain parts of your code, and really help future contributors understand your work.\n",
    "- One way comments are used is to document the major steps of complex code to help readers follow. Then, you may not have to understand the code to follow what it does. However, others would argue that this is using comments to justify bad code, and that if code requires comments to follow, it is a sign refactoring is needed.\n",

Here, you need to tell git which change to take, and some tools even allow you to edit the change manually. If it isn't straightforward, you may have to consult with the developer of the other branch to handle a merge conflict.\n",

    "We want to test our functions in a way that is repeatable and automated. Ideally, we'd run a test program that runs all our unit tests and cleanly lets us know which ones failed and which ones succeeded. Fortunately, there are great tools available in Python that we can use to create effective unit tests!\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit Test Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "- The advantage of unit tests is that they are isolated from the rest of your program, and thus, no dependencies are involved. They don't require access to databases, APIs, or other external sources of information. \n",
    "- However, passing unit tests isn't always enough to prove that our program is working successfully. \n",
    "\n",
    "To show that all the parts of our program work with each other properly, communicating and transferring data between them correctly, we use integration tests. In this lesson, we'll focus on unit tests; however, when you start building larger programs, you will want to use integration tests as well.\n",

    "- Tests can check for all the different scenarios and edge cases you can think of, before even starting to write your function. This way, when you do start implementing your function, you can run this test to get immediate feedback on whether it works or not in all the ways you can think of, as you tweak your function.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 13. Tips for Conducting a Code Review\n",
    "Now that we know what we are looking for, let's go over some tips on how to actually write your code review. When your coworker finishes up some code that they want to merge to the team's code base, they might send it to you for review. You provide feedback and suggestions, and then they may make changes and send it back to you. When you are happy with the code, you approve and it gets merged to the team's code base.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have noticed, with code reviews you are now dealing with people, not just computers. So it's important to be thoughtful of their ideas and efforts. You are in a team and there will be differences in preferences. The goal of code review isn't to make all code follow your personal preferences, but a standard of quality for the whole team.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Tip: Use a code linter\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't really a tip for code review, but can save you lots of time from code review! Using a Python code linter like [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) can automatically check for coding standards and PEP 8 guidelines for you! It's also a good idea to agree on a style guide as a team to handle disagreements on code style, whether that's an existing style guide or one you create together incrementally as a team.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Tip: Explain issues and make suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than commanding people to change their code a specific way because it's better, it will go a long way to explain to them the consequences of the current code and suggest changes to improve it. They will be much more receptive to your feedback if they understand your thought process and are accepting recommendations, rather than following commands. They also may have done it a certain way intentionally, and framing it as a suggestion promotes a constructive discussion, rather than opposition.\n",
    "- BAD: Make model evaluation code its own module - too repetitive.\n",
    "- BETTER: Make the model evaluation code its own module. This will simplify models.py to be less repetitive and focus primarily on building models.\n",
    "- GOOD: How about we consider making the model evaluation code its own module? This would simplify models.py to only include code for building models. Organizing these evaluations methods into separate functions would also allow us to reuse them with different models without repeating code.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Tip: Keep your comments objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to avoid using the words \"I\" and \"you\" in your comments. You want to avoid comments that sound personal to bring the attention of the review to the code and not to themselves.\n",
    "- BAD: I wouldn't groupby genre twice like you did here... Just compute it once and use that for your aggregations.\n",
    "- BAD: You create this groupby dataframe twice here. Just compute it once, save it as groupby_genre and then use that to get your average prices and views.\n",
    "- GOOD: Can we group by genre at the beginning of the function and then save that as a groupby object? We could then reference that object to get the average prices and views without computing groupby twice.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Tip: Provide code examples\n",
    "\n",
    "When providing a code review, you can save the author time and make it easy for them to act on your feedback by writing out your code suggestions. This shows you are willing to spend some extra time to review their code and help them out. It can also just be much quicker for you to demonstrate concepts through code rather than explanations.\n",

    "## Lesson 4: Introduction to Object-oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lesson Outline\n",
    "- Object-oriented programming syntax\n",
    "    - procedural vs object-oriented programming\n",
    "    - classes, objects, methods and attributes\n",
    "    - coding a class\n",
    "    - magic methods\n",
    "    - inheritance\n",
    "- Using object-oriented programming to make a Python package\n",
    "    - making a package\n",
    "    - tour of scikit-learn source code\n",
    "    - putting your package on PyPi\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Object-Oriented Programming?\n",
    "Object-oriented programming has a few benefits over procedural programming, which is the programming style you most likely first learned. As you'll see in this lesson,\n",
    "- object-oriented programming allows you to create large, modular programs that can easily expand over time;\n",
    "- object-oriented programs hide the implementation from the end-user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider Python packages like [Scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/). These are all Python packages built with object-oriented programming. Scikit-learn, for example, is a relatively large and complex package built with object-oriented programming. This package has expanded over the years with new functionality and new algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you train a machine learning algorithm with Scikit-learn, you don't have to know anything about how the algorithms work or how they were coded. You can focus directly on the modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example taken from the [Scikit-learn website](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn import svm\n",
    "X = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]\n",
    "y = [0, 1]\n",
    "clf = svm.SVC()\n",
    "clf.fit(X, y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How does Scikit-learn train the SVM model? You don't need to know because the implementation is hidden with object-oriented programming. If the implementation changes, you as a user of Scikit-learn might not ever find out. Whether or not you SHOULD understand how SVM works is a different question.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll practice the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. By the end of the lesson, you'll have built a Python package using object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lesson Files\n",
    "This lesson uses classroom workspaces that contain all of the files and functionality you will need. You can also find the files in the [data scientist nanodegree term 2 GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/DSND_Term2/tree/master/lessons/ObjectOrientedProgramming).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Procedural vs Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objects are defined by characteristics and actions\n",
    "Here is a reminder of what is a characteristic and what is an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "![this is caption](img/objects.png)\n",
    "*Objects are defined by their characteristics and their actions*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics and Actions in English Grammar\n",
    "Another way to think about characteristics and actions is in terms of English grammar. A characteristic would be a noun. On the other hand, an action would be a verb.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pick something from the real-world: a dog. A few characteristics could be the dog's weight, color, breed, and height. These are all nouns. What actions would a dog take? A dog can bark, run, bite and eat. These are all verbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Class, object, method, attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Vocabulary\n",
    "- class - a blueprint consisting of methods and attributes\n",
    "- object - an instance of a class. It can help to think of objects as something in the real world like a yellow pencil, a small dog, a blue shirt, etc. However, as you'll see later in the lesson, objects can be more abstract.\n",
    "- attribute - a descriptor or characteristic. Examples would be color, length, size, etc. These attributes can take on specific values like blue, 3 inches, large, etc.\n",
    "- method - an action that a class or object could take\n",
    "- OOP - a commonly used abbreviation for object-oriented programming\n",
    "- encapsulation - one of the fundamental ideas behind object-oriented programming is called encapsulation: you can combine functions and data all into a single entity. In object-oriented programming, this single entity is called a class. Encapsulation allows you to hide implementation details much like how the scikit-learn package hides the implementation of machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In English, you might hear an attribute described as a property, description, feature, quality, trait, or characteristic. All of these are saying the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a reminder of how a class, object, attributes and methods relate to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/class.png)\n",
    "*A class is a blueprint consisting of attributes and methods.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Object-Oriented Programming Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function vs Method\n",
    "In the video above at 1:44, the dialogue mistakenly calls `init` a function rather than a method. Why is `init` not a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "A function and a method look very similar. They both use the def keyword. They also have inputs and return outputs. The difference is that a method is inside of a class whereas a function is outside of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is `self`?\n",
    "If you instantiate two objects, how does Python differentiate between these two objects?\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# instantiating objects\n",
    "shirt_one = Shirt('red', 'S', 'short-sleeve', 15)\n",
    "short_two = Shirt('yellow', 'M', 'long-sleeve', 20)\n",
    "```\n",
    "That's where `self` comes into play. If you call the `change_price` method on shirt_one, how does Python know to change the price of shirt_one and not of shirt_two?\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, Python is calling the `change_price` method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def change_price(self, new_price):\n",
    "\n",
    "        self.price = new_price\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`self` is essentially a dictionary that holds all attributes and the attribute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "`self` tells Python where to look in the computer's memory for the shirt_one object. And then Python changes the price of the shirt_one object. When you call the `change_price` method, `shirt_one.change_price(12)`, self is implicitly passed in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word `self` is just a convention. You could actually use any other name as long as you are consistent; however, you should always use `self` rather than some other word or else you might confuse people.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Exercise: OOP Syntax Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. A Couple of Notes about OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set and Get methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The last part of the video mentioned that accessing attributes in Python can be somewhat different than in other programming languages like Java and C++. This section goes into further detail.\n",

    "The shirt class has a method to change the price of the shirt: `shirt_one.change_price(20)`. In Python, you can also change the values of an attribute with the following syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "shirt_one.price = 10\n",
    "shirt_one.price = 20\n",
    "shirt_one.color = 'red'\n",
    "shirt_one.size = 'M'\n",
    "shirt_one.style = 'long_sleeve'\n",
    "```\n",
    "This code accesses and changes the price, color, size and style attributes directly. Accessing attributes directly would be frowned upon in many other languages __but not in Python__. Instead, the general object-oriented programming convention is to use methods to access attributes or change attribute values. These methods are called set and get methods or setter and getter methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "A get method is for obtaining an attribute value. A set method is for changing an attribute value. If you were writing a Shirt class, the code could look like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Shirt:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, shirt_color, shirt_size, shirt_style, shirt_price):\n",
    "        self._price = shirt_price\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_price(self):\n",
    "      return self._price\n",
    "\n",
    "    def set_price(self, new_price):\n",
    "      self._price = new_price\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instantiating and using an object might look like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "shirt_one = Shirt('yellow', 'M', 'long-sleeve', 15)\n",
    "print(shirt_one.get_price())\n",
    "shirt_one.set_price(10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the class definition, the underscore in front of price is a somewhat controversial Python convention. In other languages like C++ or Java, price could be explicitly labeled as a private variable. This would prohibit an object from accessing the price attribute directly like `shirt_one._price = 15`. However, Python does not distinguish between private and public variables like other languages. Therefore, there is some controversy about using the underscore convention as well as get and set methods in Python. Why use get and set methods in Python when Python wasn't designed to use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, you'll find that some Python programmers develop object-oriented programs using get and set methods anyway. Following the Python convention, the underscore in front of price is to let a programmer know that price should only be accessed with get and set methods rather than accessing price directly with `shirt_one._price`. However, a programmer could still access `_price` directly because there is nothing in the Python language to prevent the direct access.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reiterate, a programmer could technically still do something like `shirt_one._price = 10`, and the code would work. But accessing price directly, in this case, would not be following the intent of how the Shirt class was designed.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the benefits of set and get methods is that, as previously mentioned in the course, you can hide the implementation from your user. Maybe originally a variable was coded as a list and later became a dictionary. With set and get methods, you could easily change how that variable gets accessed. Without set and get methods, you'd have to go to every place in the code that accessed the variable directly and change the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about get and set methods in Python on this [Python Tutorial site](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php).\n",

    "#### A Note about Attributes\n",
    "There are some drawbacks to accessing attributes directly versus writing a method for accessing attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of object-oriented programming, the rules in Python are a bit looser than in other programming languages. As previously mentioned, in some languages, like C++, you can explicitly state whether or not an object should be allowed to change or access an attribute's values directly. Python does not have this option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why might it be better to change a value with a method instead of directly? Changing values via a method gives you more flexibility in the long-term. What if the units of measurement change, like the store was originally meant to work in US dollars and now has to handle Euros? Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Dollars versus Euros\n",
    "If you've changed attribute values directly, you'll have to go through your code and find all the places where US dollars were used, like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "shirt_one.price = 10 # US dollars\n",
    "```\n",
    "and then manually change to Euros\n",
    "```python\n",
    "shirt_one.price = 8 # Euros\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you had used a method, then you would only have to change the method to convert from dollars to Euros.\n",
    "```\n",
    "def change_price(self, new_price):\n",
    "    self.price = new_price * 0.81 # convert dollars to Euros\n",
    "\n",
    "shirt_one.change_price(10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this introduction to object-oriented programming, you will not need to worry about updating attributes directly versus with a method; however, if you decide to further your studies of object-oriented programming, especially in another language such as C++ or Java, you'll have to take this into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modularized Code\n",
    "\n",
    "You would put the Shirt class into its own Python script called, say, shirt.py. And then in another Python script, you would import the Shirt class with a line like: `from shirt import Shirt`.\n",

    "### 8. Commenting Object-Oriented Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you notice anything special about the answer key in the previous exercise? The Pants class and the SalesPerson class contained docstrings! A docstring is a type of comment that describes how a Python module, function, class or method works. Docstrings, therefore, are not unique to object-oriented programming. This section of the course is merely reminding you to use docstrings and to comment your code. It's not just going to help you understand and maintain your code. It will also make you a better job candidate.\n",
